# Reading well-known files: full read vs `pixel list-signatures`

What reaches an agent that needs to know what a large file contains. The
baseline reads the whole file; the Pixel arm runs `pixel list-signatures
<file>`, the file's skeleton (one line per definition, with its line). Both
sides count UTF-8 bytes divided by four, as the "Reading code" table on
`/benchmarks/` and shunt's benchmark do. No second model, no agent run.

- **Command:** `scripts/bench-read-savings.sh` (downloads each file at its
  pinned commit into a throwaway repository under `$TMPDIR`).
- **Binary:** pixel 0.5.0, September 2026.
- **Files:** ten large, well-known files of popular projects, listed for
  recognition across languages (Python, TypeScript, Rust, JavaScript)
  before any saving was measured, each pinned to the last commit that
  touched it on 2026-09-25. One was dropped from the table: React's
  `ReactFiberHooks.js`, a second React file with the same Flow failure
  (19 signatures, 99.4%); `ReactFiberWorkLoop.js` stays in it, excluded,
  to show the case.

median saved (8 kept files): 94.5%

## Checking the parse

A skeleton that misses definitions looks like a bigger saving, so every row
carries the number of signatures listed, checked against the file's own
module- and class-level definitions:

| File | `def`/`class` at indent 0 or 4 | Signatures listed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Transformers `trainer.py` | 89 | 90 |
| FastAPI `routing.py` | 143 | 150 |
| LangChain `chat_models.py` | 69 | 65 |
| CPython `typing.py` | 244 | 251 |
| Django `query.py` | 180 | 186 |

(`grep -c -E '^( {4})?(async def|def|class) ' <file>`; nested functions
are not part of an outline.) React's `ReactFiberWorkLoop.js` has 125
top-level `function` declarations (`grep -c -E '^(export )?(async
)?function '`) and lists 20: its Flow type annotations break the JavaScript
grammar, so its 99.4% is excluded from the range and the median. That is a
gap in Pixel's JavaScript support, not a result.

## Reading the numbers

- The spread is real: files dense with small methods (VS Code's
  `textModel.ts`, 217 signatures in 2,745 lines) save the least, because
  the skeleton itself is long.
- This counts what the agent reads, not what a session costs: the agent may
  still open part of the file afterwards, which `pixel token-savings`
  measures on real sessions instead.
- The landing page's token wall shows the Transformers row; its caption
  quotes the range and median of the kept rows.
