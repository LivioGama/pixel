# decide-bakeoff protocol — small open decision models on Pixel's surfaces

Frozen before the first measurement run. The question: **is there an
off-the-shelf ≤500M local model that beats Jev 1.13 on coding decisions**, and
if not, which one is closest on Pixel's own decision surfaces? No training, no
4B-class model, no Jev API key — Jev numbers below are its published JevBench
rows, labelled non-reproduced.

## Why this exists

`pixel classify` already answers in Jev's shape (state + bounded labels +
criteria → probability distribution) — at the time of this protocol, using a
zero-shot static embedding
(Model2Vec potion-128M, cosine + fixed-temperature softmax; that local
backend was removed when classify went remote-only). Measured on
JevBench v1.3 public items: Intelligence 38.28, score 41.34
(`docs/bench/jevbench.md`). The published board (v1.2.16) shows Jev's coding
topic at 0.839 accuracy and no ≤500M open local model above 0.68. This pilot
measures whether that gap is real on *our* surfaces — and whether the
unmeasured `gavel-base` checkpoint changes it.

## Candidates (all open weights, CPU-runnable)

| Key | Checkpoint | Params | Decision shape | Published coding acc (v1.2.16, n=56 all tiers) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `pixel-static` | minishlab/potion-multilingual-128M via `pixel classify` | 128M | cosine+softmax | not on board (score 41.34 v1.3) |
| `gavel` | chukfinley/gavel-base | 150M | NLI entailment head, option→hypothesis | unmeasured |
| `verdict` | heman10x/rlcd-modernbert-151m (a.k.a. openjev-verdict-1.4 lineage) | 151M | GLiClass one-pass option scorer + abstention | 0.518–0.554 |
| `laya` | convaiinnovations/laya | 421M | [MASK]-per-option scorer | 0.589 |
| `gliformer` (jeff) | knowledgator/gliformer-large-v1 | ~400M | per-option span scorer | 0.679 (best ≤500M) |
| `openjev-deberta` | com-kotobalabs/open-jev-deberta-v3-large | 435M | [mean(q); mean(opt); product] head | 0.464 |
| `gte-reranker` | Alibaba-NLP/gte-reranker-modernbert-base | 149M | cross-encoder pair score → softmax | n/a (reranker class; intel 34.3 overall) |

Excluded and why: SemIf/fastjev & Qwen3.5-4B family (4B — out of scope),
djev / classifier.dev / decision-machine-1 (hosted APIs), kev/jqv/decider/smalljev
(≥0.5B decoders needing a serving stack, none above 0.68 anyway),
LambdaMART/LightGBM and teacher distillation (require training — out of scope).

## Evaluation sets

1. **coding-public**: the 14 public JevBench items whose `topics.json` topic is
   `coding` (2× adequacy noul, 4× routing choice, 1× long_policy score,
   1× trap choice, 6× judge_hard noul). Frozen as
   `scripts/fixtures/decide-coding-subset.jsonl` with sha256 recorded at freeze.
   Small — every metric carries its CI; this set anchors comparability to the
   published board, it does not by itself prove anything.
2. **plan-routing**: `scripts/fixtures/plan-routing-real-gold.jsonl` (45 real
   GitHub issues, gold label sets over 5 PlanQuery kinds), frozen as
   `scripts/fixtures/decide-plan-routing.jsonl` (225 specs) plus the item
   index `decide-plan-routing-index.json`; counts and hashes are in
   `scripts/fixtures/decide-manifest.json`. Decomposed to Jev shape as five
   independent `noul` questions per item — one per label — using label
   descriptions transcribed from the `PlanQuery` docs in
   `crates/pixel-graph/src/plan.rs`. `freeze_sets.py` records that file's
   sha256 (`plan_rs_sha256`) at freeze time; nothing re-checks it at run time,
   and the committed `plan.rs` no longer matches it (checked 2026-09-23), so
   the frozen descriptions are the reference. Exact-set match requires all
   five binary decisions correct; `score.py` reports per-label TP/FP/FN and
   `omissions` (total FN), not the weighted FP+2FN cost of
   `bench-plan-routing.py`.

Baselines: `pixel-static` (the then-shipped zero-shot backend, since
removed) on both sets;
published Jev 1.13 coding-topic accuracy 0.839 (n=56 incl. non-public items —
marked **not reproduced**, and the 14-item public subset is *not* the same
denominator, so Jev-vs-candidate on it is indicative only).

## Metrics (same discipline as the plan-routing pilots)

Per set and model: accuracy / exact-set, macro-F1, Brier, ECE (10-bin),
risk–coverage at top-probability {0.5, 0.7, 0.9}, resident-model latency
p50/p95 (model loaded once, serial requests, idle machine), cold artifact
size, peak RSS (the runner process's cumulative peak, see Method), license.
Paired bootstrap 95% CIs vs `pixel-static`, 2,000 resamples, seed 42, **not
stratified by family**: `delta_acc_ci95_vs_baseline` resamples specs (per-spec
accuracy, every set); `delta_exact_set_ci95_vs_baseline` resamples
plan-routing items, so an item's five label decisions move together — the
interval the integration gate reads.

## Pass gates (fixed in advance)

- **Beats-Jev gate**: candidate coding-subset accuracy whose CI lower bound
  clears 0.839 — expected to fail on n=14; reported for honesty, and the
  real decision input is plan-routing + the full-suite sanity run.
- **Integration gate**: beats `pixel-static` on plan-routing exact-set with
  CI excluding 0, p95 resident latency ≤ 500 ms on CPU, artifact ≤ 2 GB on
  disk, OSI license.
- **Coverage precondition for the integration gate** (added after the run,
  see Amendments): the gold set must hold at least five independently
  adjudicated positives per specialized query (`dead-interactive`,
  `dead-code`, `hotspots`, `recent-changes`) and at least five mixed-query
  task families (items whose gold needs more than one label), the adoption
  conditions of `plan-routing-real-protocol.md`. The frozen set fails it:
  all 45 gold sets are exactly `{by-concept}`, so there are zero positives
  for every specialized query and zero mixed-query families, and a constant
  `{by-concept}` predictor scores 45/45 exact-set. On this set the gate
  measures specialized false positives only and cannot be evaluated as an
  adoption gate.
- A model passing integration but not beating-Jev is reported as
  "best local option, below Jev" — not as a win.

## Method

- Each model loads once per process and answers the identical JSONL stream;
  the spec shape is `pixel classify`'s (`text`, `context`, `labels`,
  `criteria`) — adapters map to each model's native input and map its output
  back to `{label: probability}` covering the full label set. A model may not
  see gold labels or adapt its prompt per item.
- Verdict's abstention slot mass is dropped and the remainder renormalized
  (the author's own rule for bounded label sets, as upstream's
  `verdict_local` adapter does).
- Score-type criteria map list index → label string; noul maps
  `criteria["true"/"false"]` → `yes/no` labels, matching `pixel_local`.
- Model revisions are pinned by Hugging Face snapshot directory, whose name
  is the upstream revision's git commit id (`SNAPSHOTS` in `models.py`);
  `gte-reranker` loads by repository id and is not pinned, nor is the
  Verdict engine checkout (`VERDICT_ENGINE`). No SHA-256 of the
  weights is taken. `run.py` records the sha256 of `run.py`, `models.py` and
  each eval set in `manifest.json`, with the platform and Python version.
- Latency is wall-clock per decision, model resident, one decision at a time
  (torch intra-op threads set to 4, `THREADS` in `models.py`); first
  (warm-up) decision excluded from percentiles.
- Peak RSS is `getrusage(RUSAGE_SELF)` of the runner after a model's last
  spec, normalised to bytes (`ru_maxrss` is KiB on Linux, bytes on macOS):
  the cumulative peak of the one process that ran every model in sequence,
  so it can include memory held from earlier models, and it excludes child
  processes (the `pixel classify` child behind `pixel-static` and
  `remote-cli`). `run.py` records it as `runner_peak_rss_bytes`; the
  committed manifests under `scripts/bench-decide/runs/` predate the rename
  and call it `peak_rss_bytes` (all macOS, so already in bytes).

## What this pilot does not claim

- Comparability to the JevBench Score (that needs the maintainer-run 534-item
  set and their latency/cost conventions).
- Anything about ranking/retrieval quality — reranker candidates here are
  evaluated only on the decision task they were scored on upstream.

## Amendments after the run

The protocol above was frozen before run1; these corrections were made after
it, in review, and change no measured figure:

- Item count corrected from 47 to 45, the committed gold set.
- Claims the harness never implemented were replaced by what it does: no
  run-time `SOURCE_HASH` check, no SHA-256 weight pinning, no
  family-stratified bootstrap, no FP+2FN cost.
- `delta_exact_set_ci95_vs_baseline` (item resampling) was added to
  `score.py`; run1's committed `summary.json` predates it and carries only the
  per-spec `delta_acc_ci95_vs_baseline`, which `score.py` still reproduces
  exactly.
- Risk–coverage now thresholds the top probability; run1's committed
  `summary.json` used `min(max(p, 1 - p))`, which only equals the top
  probability for two labels, so its coding-public risk–coverage rows differ
  from a rescore. Plan-routing rows (two labels) are unchanged.
- The coverage precondition on the integration gate is post hoc, and the
  frozen set does not meet it.
