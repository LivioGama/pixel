# Cost of the whole-tree freshness check (`tree_delta`)

`pixel_graph::build::tree_delta(root, db)` is the check the daemon runs when
it reopens the graph, and the check the `pixel evaluate` design makes a
precondition of every answer: once before the traversal, once after, so a
negative answer is never certified against a working tree that moved. Its
cost is therefore the floor under every `evaluate` call. This page measures
it as it is called, on this repository and on a synthetic 50 000-file tree,
and reads the numbers against the design note's targets.

Re-run with one command (the harness prints these tables):

```sh
cargo bench -p pixel-bench --bench tree_delta
# knobs: PIXEL_BENCH_TREE_ROOT=<dir> PIXEL_BENCH_SYNTH_FILES=50000 PIXEL_BENCH_ITERS=25 PIXEL_BENCH_RAW=1
```

## Method

- Harness: `crates/pixel-bench/benches/tree_delta.rs`, `harness = false`,
  plain `Instant` timing (criterion's sampling adds nothing to a call this
  long). For each subject: `build_graph` into a temp db, one "first run"
  `tree_delta`, then N warm iterations alternating two lanes.
- Lane `tree_delta`: the real call, walk + content hash + comparison with
  the `files` table. Lane `freshness_signature`: the same walk and hash
  without the db. The API exposes no timer inside `tree_delta`, so the db
  share is reported as the difference of the two lanes' p50, labelled
  derived.
- Subject (a): this worktree's tree (`249` supported source files after
  the walk policy). Subject (b): `50 000` Rust files, each a small module
  with four real items padded with comment lines to 1 024–4 096 bytes,
  spread over 400 directories, written to a temp dir the harness removes.
  The 50 000 figure is exactly `DEFAULT_GRAPH_MAX_FILES`; the walk in
  `tree_delta` has no cap, so the two file sets match.
- "First run" is the first `tree_delta` after `build_graph` in the same
  process. It is **not** a cold-cache figure: `build_graph` has just read
  every file, so the page cache is warm. macOS gives no unprivileged way to
  drop it (`purge` needs root, and this bench does not ask for it). A true
  cold number was not measured.
- Machine: Apple M2, 8 cores, 16 GiB, Apple Fabric SSD, macOS 26.6.2,
  Spotlight indexing enabled on `/`. Rayon threads available: 8 (the walk
  does not use them, see Reading). Pixel commit `6bc8acf`. Release profile
  (`cargo bench`).

Same machine, about fifteen minutes later, **under load**: a sibling
worktree was running `cargo build`/`cargo test` for another change, plus a
Rails app's Sidekiq workers; `uptime` right after the run read load
averages 2.99 / 4.48 / 5.88 on 8 cores.

Sorted `tree_delta` samples, run 2: 6 426 … 6 985 (median) … 7 557,
7 907, 8 161, 8 373, 8 403, 8 619, 8 709, 13 715 ms. No fast mode at all:
run 1's 1.3–1.6 s band did not reappear under load.

**The two runs disagree by 4× on the 50 000-file tree and agree within
noise on the 249-file tree.** Run 1's few 8 s samples are the same regime
run 2 lived in throughout. The serial walk (see Reading) competes for one
core with everything else on the machine, so the 50 000-file cost is best
stated as a range, 1.3 s idle to 7 s loaded, not a point.

## Reading against the design note's targets

The targets were warm p95 under 100 ms for a hook and under 300 ms for an
agent call, whole-tree check included, with the check run twice per
`evaluate` (before and after the traversal).

- **This repository (249 files): met.** Two checks cost about 32 ms at p50
  and 35 ms at p95; the traversal budget of 250 ms has room. The db
  comparison is under 1 ms; the walk and hashing are the whole cost.
- **The 50 000-file tree: not met, by one to two orders of magnitude.** One
  check is 1.6 s at p50 on an idle machine (run 1) and 7.0 s under ordinary
  developer load (run 2). Two checks per call put a 50 000-file repository
  between 3 s and 14 s. `evaluate` cannot run this check synchronously at
  that size; the design note's "measured, not claimed" clause applies and
  the note must say so.
- **Why it is this slow, from the code, not the profiler**: `tree_hashes`
  in `build.rs` walks, reads and hashes every file in one serial iterator
  (`walker.flatten().filter_map(..)`), then sorts. Its doc comment says the
  hashing is "parallelized via rayon"; the code does not do that. The
  build path (`collect_files` then `into_par_iter`) is parallel; the
  freshness walk is not. Parallelising the read + hash over the 8 cores is
  the obvious first lever, and the derived db share (70 ms) says the
  SQLite comparison is not the problem.
- **The slow regime is load, first of all.** Run 2 reproduced run 1's 8 s
  outliers as its steady state while other builds ran; a serial walk gets
  one core's worth of a contended machine. Spotlight (indexing enabled on
  `/`, the tree written under `/var/folders`) may add to it, since an
  indexer reading 50 000 fresh files would compete for the same I/O; that
  part is a hypothesis, not a measurement. `PIXEL_BENCH_RAW=1` prints every
  sample so the shape of a run is visible, and an idle-machine re-run is
  the way to separate the two.
- **Size cap**: files over `MAX_FILE_BYTES` (4 MiB) are skipped by both the
  build and the freshness walk; the synthetic files are far below it, so
  the cap did not shape these numbers.

What this changes for `evaluate`: the snapshot contract stays (whole-tree
before and after), the cost does not fit a synchronous hook above a few
thousand files today, and the two levers are a parallel `tree_hashes` and,
if that is not enough, reusing the daemon's watcher-maintained signature
with the after-check limited to files the watcher reported since the
before-check. Both are changes to `build.rs`, out of this page's scope.
