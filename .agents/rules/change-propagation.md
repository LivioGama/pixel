# Change Propagation

Always loaded: a change is finished when every path that produces or reads
the value it changed agrees with it, not when the path you started from does.

Each rule below is the largest class of CodeRabbit findings on #222 to #264
(about 18 of 105), fixed after review instead of before it.

- **List every producer and reader before the first test.** When a change
  adds an input to a value — a scope, an alias, a cap, a phase, a filter, a
  route — run `pixel who-calls <entry point>` on the function that computes
  it and `pixel search-content` on the field it stores, and write the list
  down. Each path on it either takes the new input or says why it does not.
  Missed on #264: the unresolved-site diagnostic still called `decide`
  without a site line, and the reference prefilter `names_a_symbol` ignored
  the import's scope, although `resolve_calls` passed it. Missed on #254:
  `search-content -l` bypassed the stdout byte cap and printed a path once
  per root, although the line-printing path already did both.
- **A variant without the new input is a bug until it says otherwise.** A
  sibling that recomputes the value from what it had before (`decide` beside
  `decide_at`, a demotion that rebuilds a call's name from the target's
  `dst.name`) keeps the old behaviour on its path. Route it through the new
  input, or give it a doc comment naming what it cannot know and what it does
  instead. #262 lost the `leased()` → `push` edge on the next incremental
  update because `write_rows` demoted incoming edges under `sym.name`.
- **Stored rows that change need their version bump.** Rows an unchanged
  source now produces differently are stale until rebuilt: bump the version
  constant that gates them (`EXTRACTOR_VERSION` in `pixel-graph`, the concept
  extractor's version) in the same commit, with a line in its history
  comment. #255 shipped without it and every existing graph kept the old
  unresolved edges (fixed in #258).
- **A named constant is the only spelling.** When a constant exists for a
  path, a limit or a default (`GRAPH_DB_FILE`, `SEARCH_DEFAULT_ROWS`), every
  other site uses it; a literal copy drifts the day the constant moves (#222
  wrote the graph file name by hand in index bundles; the first version of
  #258 gave a filtered search 10 000 rows where the daemon default is 100).
- **A new secret reaches every sink masked.** A flag or positional that
  carries a credential is masked in the action log (`logged_args` in
  `crates/pixel/src/main.rs`), metrics, recall transcripts and error messages
  before it ships, with a test that reads the sink back. #222 recorded
  `config remote-key <preset> <key>` in clear text in `.pixel/actions.jsonl`.
- **Measure from where the cost starts.** A timer or a counter added to one
  route is placed around what that route actually spends, and a sibling
  route that skips a step records the step as absent, not as zero. #241 and
  #242 each needed a fix for a probe or an open timed outside its bracket.
