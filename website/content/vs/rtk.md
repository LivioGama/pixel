title: "Pixel vs RTK"
description: "Pixel and RTK both save an agent's tokens, on different sides: RTK compresses what shell commands print, Pixel answers from an index so the agent reads less. They run together in Claude Code."
tool: "rtk"

## How they differ

RTK sits between the agent and its shell: `cargo build`, `git status` or a test run go through it, and the agent gets a short summary instead of the full log. Pixel works before that, when the agent looks for code: `pixel scope-task` names the files a task starts in, `pixel list-signatures` outlines a large file, and `pixel impact` lists a symbol's callers and callees, so the agent opens fewer whole files.

## Running both

Install RTK first, then run `pixel install`. In Claude Code, only one `PreToolUse` hook should rewrite a shell call, so Pixel adopts RTK's exact `rtk hook claude` registration: its guard rewrites the searches it knows (`grep`, `rg`) and hands every other call to RTK. The registration it adopted is saved in `.claude/pixel-rtk-hooks.json` and goes back into your settings when you uninstall Pixel. `pixel doctor` reports a backup left without a guard to use it.

## Choosing

Pick RTK if your agent's context fills with build and test output. Pick Pixel if it fills with files opened to find its way, and for callers, blast radius and Git history. If both happen, run both.
